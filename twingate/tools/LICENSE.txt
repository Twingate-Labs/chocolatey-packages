User Terms of Service

Version date: May 26, 2020

Thanks for using Twingate! These user terms of service (“Terms”) and the [Customer Agreement](https://www.twingate.com/terms/) cover your access and use of our Services. Capitalized terms used below but not defined will have the meaning assigned to them in the Customer Agreement.

By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms.

1. YOU, CUSTOMER AND TWINGATE
An organization or other third party that we refer to in these User Terms of Service as “Customer” has invited you to create or use a Twingate account, or download Twingate Software. The Customer has separately agreed to our Customer Terms or entered into a written agreement with us (in either case, the “Customer Agreement”) that permitted the Customer to create a Twingate account so that you and others could join. When you (as a User) set up an account for the Services or download and use Twingate Software, you acknowledge and agree that the Customer has certain choices and controls over your use of the Services. For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, and manage permissions or other settings, and these choices and instructions may result in changes to your access to the Services or use, disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data.

2. USE OF SERVICES
2.1 Services. By using the Services, you agree that:

(a) you are over the age of 16 and are the intended recipient of Customer’s invitation to the Services;

(b) you will safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current; and

(c) you are not: (i) located in any country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; or (ii) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

2.2 Restrictions. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in writing by Twingate, you will not (and will not allow a third party to):

(a) lease, sell, resell or use for timesharing or service bureau purposes the Services;

(b) interfere with, disrupt, alter, or modify any Services, or create an undue burden on the Services or the networks or services connected to the Services;

(c) engage in abusive or excessive usage of the Services, which usage is significantly in excess of average usage patterns that adversely affects the speed, responsiveness, stability, availability or functionality of the Services;

(d) use any framing techniques to enclose any Twingate Mark or Twingate Materials (defined below) or use any meta tags or other “hidden text” using the Twingate Marks;

(e) introduce unauthorized software or automated agents or scripts into the Services so as to create multiple accounts, generate automated searches, requests or queries, or to strip or mine data from the Services;

(f) use any method (whether manual or automated) to extract or scrape data from the Services;

(g) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, techniques, processes, algorithms, know-how or other information from the binary code portions of the Software by any means whatsoever, unless this restriction is prohibited by law;

(h) perform or publish any benchmark tests or analyses relating to the Services;

(i) purchase, access, or use the Services for the purpose of building or improving a competitive product or service, or for any other competitive purpose;

For example, you may not use the Services to collect, protect, or otherwise handle “protected health information” (as defined in 45 C.F.R. §160.103 under United States federal regulations) without entering into a separate business associate agreement with Twingate that permits you to do so;

(p) you will not attempt to access, search, or create accounts for any of our Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces or as otherwise authorized by us;

(q) you will not use the Services to process, store or transmit material, including any Customer Data, in violation of any law or any third party rights, including without limitation intellectual property and privacy rights; or

(r) you will not use the Services in any circumstances where failure could lead to death, personal injury or environmental damage, and you further acknowledge that the Services are not designed or intended for such use.

3. SOFTWARE LICENSE

8. TERMINATION
If we believe that there is a violation of the Agreement, these Terms or any of our other policies that can be remedied by Customer, we will, in most cases, ask Customer to take action rather than intervene. However, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if you are in breach of these Terms.

These Terms remain effective until Customer’s subscription for you terminates, or your access to the Services has been terminated by Customer or us. Please contact Customer if you wish to terminate your account.

9. UPDATES TO THESE TERMS
Twingate may make changes to these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or to account for new Services or functionality. The most current version of these Terms will be posted on the Twingate website. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to these Terms, you should stop using the Services, because by continuing to use the Services after the date the changes become effective, you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated Terms.
